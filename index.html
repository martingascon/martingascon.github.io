<p> My name is Martín Gascón and I am an experimental nuclear physicist with  a passion for science and technology. This all started when I was 14 after reading "A Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking. Captivated and enlightened by this book, I started thinking about human beings and how they are able to explain their universe with such a great detail. I enjoy exploring nature and its complicated ways expressing itself. I always thought there were simpler equations to explain complicated phenomena. I enjoy traveling, playing guitar, photography, and overall discovering how things work </p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I do</h3>
<p> My research is focused on the study of materials that can be used as radiation detectors for homeland security applications (e. g. to monitor the entrance of radioactive materials into  airports, ports or through ground transportation at the borders).  My work is to find the best combination of chemical elements, grow out a crystal from it, and study the material under the excitation of X-rays and gamma rays as if they were under the exposure of radioactive materials.  For this purpose, I created a simulation to show the path of electrons inside the material and built a microscope to measure the optimal light emission (fluorescence) that these materials must have in order to distinguish the different radioactive isotopes that might be present on the material being investigated.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
